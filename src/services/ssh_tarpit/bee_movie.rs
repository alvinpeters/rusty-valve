    b"You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\r\n",
    b"Jock. You have to be bred for that.\r\n",
    b"Right.\r\n",
    b"Look. That's more pollen\r\n",
    b"than you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\n",
    b"It's just a status symbol.\r\n",
    b"Bees make too much of it.\r\n",

    b"against a mushroom!\r\n",
    b"He had a paw on my throat,\r\n",
    b"and with the other, he was slapping me!\r\n",
    b"- Oh, my!\r\n",
    b"- I never thought I'd knock him out.\r\n",
    b"What were you doing during this?\r\n",
    b"Trying to alert the authorities.\r\n",
    b"I can autograph that.\r\n",
    b"A little gusty out there today,\r\n",
    b"wasn't it, comrades?\r\n",
    b"Yeah. Gusty.\r\n",
    b"We're hitting a sunflower patch\r\n",
    b"six miles from here tomorrow.\r\n",
    b"- Six miles, huh?\r\n",
    b"- Barry!\r\n",
    b"A puddle jump for us,\r\n",

    b"- Maybe I am.\r\n",
    b"- You are not!\r\n",
    b"We're going 0900 at J-Gate.\r\n",
    b"What do you think, buzzy-boy?\r\n",
    b"Are you bee enough?\r\n",

    b"on what 0900 means.\r\n",
    b"Hey, Honex!\r\n",
    b"Dad, you surprised me.\r\n",
    b"You decide what you're interested in?\r\n",
    b"- Well, there's a lot of choices.\r\n",
    b"- But you only get one.\r\n",
    b"Do you ever get bored\r\n",
    b"doing the same job every day?\r\n",
    b"Son, let me tell you about stirring.\r\n",
    b"You grab that stick, and you just\r\n",
    b"move it around, and you stir it around.\r\n",
    b"You get yourself into a rhythm.\r\n",
    b"It's a beautiful thing.\r\n",
    b"You know, Dad,\r\n",
    b"the more I think about it,\r\n",
    b"maybe the honey field\r\n",
    b"just isn't right for me.\r\n",
    b"You were thinking of what,\r\n",
    b"making balloon animals?\r\n",
    b"That's a bad job\r\n",
    b"for a guy with a stinger.\r\n",
    b"Janet, your son's not sure\r\n",
    b"he wants to go into honey!\r\n",

    b"- No one's listening to me!\r\n",

    b"I could say anything right now.\r\n",
    b"I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\r\n",
    b"Let's open some honey and celebrate!\r\n",
    b"Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.\r\n",
    b"Shave my antennae.\r\n",
    b"Shack up with a grasshopper. Get\r\n",
    b"a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!\r\n",
    b"I'm so proud.\r\n",
    b"- We're starting work today!\r\n",

    b"not for the reason you think.\r\n",
    b"- Any chance of getting the Krelman?\r\n",
    b"- Sure, you're on.\r\n",
    b"I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\r\n",
    b"Wax monkey's always open.\r\n",
    b"The Krelman opened up again.\r\n",
    b"What happened?\r\n",
    b"A bee died. Makes an opening. See?\r\n",
    b"He's dead. Another dead one.\r\n",
    b"Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.\r\n",
    b"Dead from the neck up.\r\n",

    b"That is one nectar collector!\r\n",
    b"- Ever see pollination up close?\r\n",
    b"- No, sir.\r\n",
    b"I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it\r\n",
    b"over here. Maybe a dash over there,\r\n",
    b"a pinch on that one.\r\n",
    b"See that? It's a little bit of magic.\r\n",
    b"That's amazing. Why do we do that?\r\n",
    b"That's pollen power. More pollen, more\r\n",
    b"flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\r\n",
    b"Cool.\r\n",
    b"I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.\r\n",

    b"He blinked!\r\n",
    b"Spray him, Granny!\r\n",
    b"What are you doing?!\r\n",

    b"No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.\r\n",
    b"They're out of their minds.\r\n",
    b"When I leave a job interview, they're\r\n",
    b"flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.\r\n",
    b"There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.\r\n",
    b"I don't remember the sun\r\n",
    b"having a big 75 on it.\r\n",
    b"I predicted global warming.\r\n",

    b"Stand back. These are winter boots.\r\n",
    b"Wait!\r\n",
    b"Don't kill him!\r\n",
    b"You know I'm allergic to them!\r\n",
    b"This thing could kill me!\r\n",
    b"Why does his life have\r\n",
    b"less value than yours?\r\n",
    b"Why does his life have any less value\r\n",
    b"than mine? Is that your statement?\r\n",
    b"I'm just saying all life has value. You\r\n",
    b"don't know what he's capable of feeling.\r\n",
    b"My brochure!\r\n",
    b"There you go, little guy.\r\n",
    b"I'm not scared of him.\r\n",
    b"It's an allergic thing.\r\n",
    b"Put that on your resume brochure.\r\n",
    b"My whole face could puff up.\r\n",
    b"Make it one of your special skills.\r\n",
    b"Knocking someone out\r\n",
    b"is also a special skill.\r\n",
    b"Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.\r\n",
    b"- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?\r\n",
    b"- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.\r\n",

    b"- Bye.\r\n",
    b"I gotta say something.\r\n",

    b"I gotta say something.\r\n",
    b"All right, here it goes.\r\n",
    b"Nah.\r\n",
    b"What would I say?\r\n",
    b"I could really get in trouble.\r\n",
    b"It's a bee law.\r\n",
    b"You're not supposed to talk to a human.\r\n",
    b"I can't believe I'm doing this.\r\n",
    b"I've got to.\r\n",
    b"Oh, I can't do it. Come on!\r\n",
    b"No. Yes. No.\r\n",
    b"Do it. I can't.\r\n",
    b"How should I start it?\r\n",
    b"\"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good.\r\n",
    b"Here she comes! Speak, you fool!\r\n",

    b"But I don't recall going to bed.\r\n",
    b"Well, I'm sure this\r\n",
    b"is very disconcerting.\r\n",
    b"This is a bit of a surprise to me.\r\n",
    b"I mean, you're a bee!\r\n",
    b"I am. And I'm not supposed\r\n",
    b"to be doing this,\r\n",
    b"but they were all trying to kill me.\r\n",
    b"And if it wasn't for you...\r\n",
    b"I had to thank you.\r\n",
    b"It's just how I was raised.\r\n",
    b"That was a little weird.\r\n",
    b"- I'm talking with a bee.\r\n",
    b"- Yeah.\r\n",
    b"I'm talking to a bee.\r\n",
    b"And the bee is talking to me!\r\n",
    b"I just want to say I'm grateful.\r\n",
    b"I'll leave now.\r\n",
    b"- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\r\n",
    b"- What?\r\n",
    b"The talking thing.\r\n",
    b"Same way you did, I guess.\r\n",
    b"\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\r\n",
    b"- That's very funny.\r\n",
    b"- Yeah.\r\n",
    b"Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\r\n",
    b"we'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\n",
    b"Anyway...\r\n",
    b"Can I...\r\n",
    b"...get you something?\r\n",
    b"- Like what?\r\n",
    b"I don't know. I mean...\r\n",
    b"I don't know. Coffee?\r\n",
    b"I don't want to put you out.\r\n",
    b"It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\r\n",
    b"- It's just coffee.\r\n",
    b"- I hate to impose.\r\n",
    b"- Don't be ridiculous!\r\n",
    b"- Actually, I would love a cup.\r\n",
    b"Hey, you want rum cake?\r\n",
    b"- I shouldn't.\r\n",
    b"- Have some.\r\n",
    b"- No, I can't.\r\n",
    b"- Come on!\r\n",
    b"I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\r\n",
    b"- Where?\r\n",
    b"- These stripes don't help.\r\n",
    b"You look great!\r\n",
    b"I don't know if you know\r\n",
    b"anything about fashion.\r\n",
    b"Are you all right?\r\n",
    b"No.\r\n",

    b"And he says, \"Watermelon?\r\n",
    b"I thought you said Guatemalan.\r\n",
    b"Why would I marry a watermelon?\"\r\n",
    b"Is that a bee joke?\r\n",
    b"That's the kind of stuff we do.\r\n",
    b"Yeah, different.\r\n",
    b"So, what are you gonna do, Barry?\r\n",
    b"About work? I don't know.\r\n",
    b"I want to do my part for the hive,\r\n",
    b"but I can't do it the way they want.\r\n",
    b"I know how you feel.\r\n",
    b"- You do?\r\n",
    b"- Sure.\r\n",
    b"My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\r\n",
    b"a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\r\n",
    b"- Really?\r\n",
    b"- My only interest is flowers.\r\n",
    b"Our new queen was just elected\r\n",
    b"with that same campaign slogan.\r\n",
    b"Anyway, if you look...\r\n",
    b"There's my hive right there. See it?\r\n",
    b"You're in Sheep Meadow!\r\n",
    b"Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\r\n",
    b"No way! I know that area.\r\n",
    b"I lost a toe ring there once.\r\n",
    b"- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\r\n",
    b"- Why not?\r\n",
    b"- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r\n",
    b"- Maybe I'll try that.\r\n",
    b"- You all right, ma'am?\r\n",
    b"- Oh, yeah. Fine.\r\n",
    b"Just having two cups of coffee!\r\n",
    b"Anyway, this has been great.\r\n",
    b"Thanks for the coffee.\r\n",
    b"Yeah, it's no trouble.\r\n",
    b"Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\r\n",
    b"I'd be up the rest of my life.\r\n",
    b"Are you...?\r\n",
    b"Can I take a piece of this with me?\r\n",
    b"Sure! Here, have a crumb.\r\n",
    b"- Thanks!\r\n",
    b"- Yeah.\r\n",
    b"All right. Well, then...\r\n",
    b"I guess I'll see you around.\r\n",
    b"Or not.\r\n",
    b"OK, Barry.\r\n",
    b"And thank you\r\n",
    b"so much again... for before.\r\n",
    b"Oh, that? That was nothing.\r\n",
    b"Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...\r\n",
    b"This can't possibly work.\r\n",
    b"He's all set to go.\r\n",
    b"We may as well try it.\r\n",
    b"OK, Dave, pull the chute.\r\n",
    b"- Sounds amazing.\r\n",
    b"- It was amazing!\r\n",
    b"It was the scariest,\r\n",
    b"happiest moment of my life.\r\n",
    b"Humans! I can't believe\r\n",
    b"you were with humans!\r\n",
    b"Giant, scary humans!\r\n",
    b"What were they like?\r\n",
    b"Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.\r\n",
    b"They eat crazy giant things.\r\n",
    b"They drive crazy.\r\n",
    b"- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\r\n",
    b"- Some of them. But some of them don't.\r\n",
    b"- How'd you get back?\r\n",
    b"- Poodle.\r\n",
    b"You did it, and I'm glad. You saw\r\n",
    b"whatever you wanted to see.\r\n",
    b"You had your \"experience.\" Now you\r\n",
    b"can pick out yourjob and be normal.\r\n",
    b"- Well...\r\n",
    b"- Well?\r\n",
    b"Well, I met someone.\r\n",
    b"You did? Was she Bee-ish?\r\n",
    b"- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\r\n",
    b"- No, no, no, not a wasp.\r\n",
    b"- Spider?\r\n",
    b"- I'm not attracted to spiders.\r\n",
    b"I know it's the hottest thing,\r\n",
    b"with the eight legs and all.\r\n",
    b"I can't get by that face.\r\n",
    b"So who is she?\r\n",
    b"She's... human.\r\n",
    b"No, no. That's a bee law.\r\n",
    b"You wouldn't break a bee law.\r\n",
    b"- Her name's Vanessa.\r\n",
    b"- Oh, boy.\r\n",
    b"She's so nice. And she's a florist!\r\n",
    b"Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!\r\n",
    b"We're not dating.\r\n",
    b"You're flying outside the hive, talking\r\n",
    b"to humans that attack our homes\r\n",
    b"with power washers and M-80s!\r\n",
    b"One-eighth a stick of dynamite!\r\n",
    b"She saved my life!\r\n",
    b"And she understands me.\r\n",
    b"This is over!\r\n",
    b"Eat this.\r\n",
    b"This is not over! What was that?\r\n",
    b"- They call it a crumb.\r\n",
    b"- It was so stingin' stripey!\r\n",
    b"And that's not what they eat.\r\n",
    b"That's what falls off what they eat!\r\n",
    b"- You know what a Cinnabon is?\r\n",
    b"- No.\r\n",
    b"It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\r\n",
    b"They heat it up...\r\n",
    b"Sit down!\r\n",
    b"...really hot!\r\n",
    b"- Listen to me!\r\n",
    b"We are not them! We're us.\r\n",
    b"There's us and there's them!\r\n",
    b"Yes, but who can deny\r\n",
    b"the heart that is yearning?\r\n",
    b"There's no yearning.\r\n",
    b"Stop yearning. Listen to me!\r\n",
    b"You have got to start thinking bee,\r\n",
    b"my friend. Thinking bee!\r\n",
    b"- Thinking bee.\r\n",
    b"- Thinking bee.\r\n",
    b"Thinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n",
    b"Thinking bee! Thinking bee!\r\n",
    b"There he is. He's in the pool.\r\n",
    b"You know what your problem is, Barry?\r\n",
    b"I gotta start thinking bee?\r\n",
    b"How much longer will this go on?\r\n",
    b"It's been three days!\r\n",
    b"Why aren't you working?\r\n",
    b"I've got a lot of big life decisions\r\n",
    b"to think about.\r\n",
    b"What life? You have no life!\r\n",
    b"You have no job. You're barely a bee!\r\n",
    b"Would it kill you\r\n",
    b"to make a little honey?\r\n",
    b"Barry, come out.\r\n",
    b"Your father's talking to you.\r\n",
    b"Martin, would you talk to him?\r\n",
    b"Barry, I'm talking to you!\r\n",

    b"Watch this!\r\n",
    b"Vanessa!\r\n",
    b"- We're still here.\r\n",
    b"- I told you not to yell at him.\r\n",
    b"He doesn't respond to yelling!\r\n",
    b"- Then why yell at me?\r\n",
    b"- Because you don't listen!\r\n",
    b"I'm not listening to this.\r\n",
    b"Sorry, I've gotta go.\r\n",
    b"- Where are you going?\r\n",
    b"- I'm meeting a friend.\r\n",
    b"A girl? Is this why you can't decide?\r\n",
    b"Bye.\r\n",
    b"I just hope she's Bee-ish.\r\n",
    b"They have a huge parade\r\n",
    b"of flowers every year in Pasadena?\r\n",
    b"To be in the Tournament of Roses,\r\n",
    b"that's every florist's dream!\r\n",
    b"Up on a float, surrounded\r\n",
    b"by flowers, crowds cheering.\r\n",
    b"A tournament. Do the roses\r\n",
    b"compete in athletic events?\r\n",
    b"No. All right, I've got one.\r\n",
    b"How come you don't fly everywhere?\r\n",
    b"It's exhausting. Why don't you\r\n",
    b"run everywhere? It's faster.\r\n",
    b"Yeah, OK, I see, I see.\r\n",
    b"All right, your turn.\r\n",
    b"TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?\r\n",
    b"That's insane!\r\n",
    b"You don't have that?\r\n",
    b"We have Hivo, but it's a disease.\r\n",
    b"It's a horrible, horrible disease.\r\n",
    b"Oh, my.\r\n",
    b"Dumb bees!\r\n",
    b"You must want to sting all those jerks.\r\n",
    b"We try not to sting.\r\n",
    b"It's usually fatal for us.\r\n",
    b"So you have to watch your temper.\r\n",
    b"Very carefully.\r\n",
    b"You kick a wall, take a walk,\r\n",
    b"write an angry letter and throw it out.\r\n",
    b"Work through it like any emotion:\r\n",
    b"Anger, jealousy, lust.\r\n",
    b"Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?\r\n",
    b"Yeah.\r\n",
    b"- What is wrong with you?!\r\n",
    b"- It's a bug.\r\n",

    b"Yeah, it was. How did you know?\r\n",
    b"It felt like about 10 pages.\r\n",
    b"Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.\r\n",
    b"You've really got that\r\n",
    b"down to a science.\r\n",
    b"- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.\r\n",
    b"- I'll bet.\r\n",

    b"- For people. We eat it.\r\n",
    b"You don't have\r\n",
    b"enough food of your own?\r\n",
    b"- Well, yes.\r\n",
    b"- How do you get it?\r\n",
    b"- Bees make it.\r\n",
    b"- I know who makes it!\r\n",
    b"And it's hard to make it!\r\n",
    b"There's heating, cooling, stirring.\r\n",
    b"You need a whole Krelman thing!\r\n",
    b"- It's organic.\r\n",
    b"- It's our-ganic!\r\n",
    b"It's just honey, Barry.\r\n",
    b"Just what?!\r\n",
    b"Bees don't know about this!\r\n",
    b"This is stealing! A lot of stealing!\r\n",
    b"You've taken our homes, schools,\r\n",
    b"hospitals! This is all we have!\r\n",
    b"And it's on sale?!\r\n",
    b"I'm getting to the bottom of this.\r\n",

    b"of all of this!\r\n",
    b"Hey, Hector.\r\n",
    b"- You almost done?\r\n",
    b"- Almost.\r\n",
    b"He is here. I sense it.\r\n",
    b"Well, I guess I'll go home now\r\n",
    b"and just leave this nice honey out,\r\n",
    b"with no one around.\r\n",
    b"You're busted, box boy!\r\n",
    b"I knew I heard something.\r\n",
    b"So you can talk!\r\n",
    b"I can talk.\r\n",
    b"And now you'll start talking!\r\n",
    b"Where you getting the sweet stuff?\r\n",

    b"What? You're not dead?\r\n",
    b"Do I look dead? They will wipe anything\r\n",
    b"that moves. Where you headed?\r\n",
    b"To Honey Farms.\r\n",

    b"Wow!\r\n",
    b"I assume wherever this truck goes\r\n",
    b"is where they're getting it.\r\n",
    b"I mean, that honey's ours.\r\n",
    b"- Bees hang tight.\r\n",
    b"- We're all jammed in.\r\n",
    b"It's a close community.\r\n",

    b"Yeah. It doesn't last too long.\r\n",
    b"Do you know you're\r\n",
    b"in a fake hive with fake walls?\r\n",
    b"Our queen was moved here.\r\n",
    b"We had no choice.\r\n",
    b"This is your queen?\r\n",
    b"That's a man in women's clothes!\r\n",
    b"That's a drag queen!\r\n",
    b"What is this?\r\n",
    b"Oh, no!\r\n",
    b"There's hundreds of them!\r\n",
    b"Bee honey.\r\n",
    b"Our honey is being brazenly stolen\r\n",
    b"on a massive scale!\r\n",
    b"This is worse than anything bears\r\n",
    b"have done! I intend to do something.\r\n",
    b"Oh, Barry, stop.\r\n",
    b"Who told you humans are taking\r\n",
    b"our honey? That's a rumor.\r\n",
    b"Do these look like rumors?\r\n",
    b"That's a conspiracy theory.\r\n",
    b"These are obviously doctored photos.\r\n",
    b"How did you get mixed up in this?\r\n",
    b"He's been talking to humans.\r\n",
    b"- What?\r\n",
    b"- Talking to humans?!\r\n",
    b"He has a human girlfriend.\r\n",
    b"And they make out!\r\n",
    b"Make out? Barry!\r\n",
    b"We do not.\r\n",
    b"- You wish you could.\r\n",
    b"- Whose side are you on?\r\n",
    b"The bees!\r\n",
    b"I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.\r\n",
    b"Those crazy legs kept me up all night.\r\n",
    b"Barry, this is what you want\r\n",
    b"to do with your life?\r\n",
    b"I want to do it for all our lives.\r\n",
    b"Nobody works harder than bees!\r\n",
    b"Dad, I remember you\r\n",
    b"coming home so overworked\r\n",
    b"your hands were still stirring.\r\n",
    b"You couldn't stop.\r\n",
    b"I remember that.\r\n",
    b"What right do they have to our honey?\r\n",
    b"We live on two cups a year. They put it\r\n",
    b"in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!\r\n",
    b"Even if it's true, what can one bee do?\r\n",
    b"Sting them where it really hurts.\r\n",
    b"In the face! The eye!\r\n",
    b"- That would hurt.\r\n",
    b"- No.\r\n",
    b"Up the nose? That's a killer.\r\n",
    b"There's only one place you can sting\r\n",
    b"the humans, one place where it matters.\r\n",
    b"Hive at Five, the hive's only\r\n",
    b"full-hour action news source.\r\n",
    b"No more bee beards!\r\n",
    b"With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.\r\n",
    b"Weather with Storm Stinger.\r\n",
    b"Sports with Buzz Larvi.\r\n",
    b"And Jeanette Chung.\r\n",
    b"- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.\r\n",
    b"- And I'm Jeanette Chung.\r\n",
    b"A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,\r\n",
    b"intends to sue the human race\r\n",
    b"for stealing our honey,\r\n",
    b"packaging it and profiting\r\n",
    b"from it illegally!\r\n",
    b"Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,\r\n",
    b"we'll have three former queens here in\r\n",
    b"our studio, discussing their new book,\r\n",
    b"Classy Ladies,\r\n",
    b"out this week on Hexagon.\r\n",
    b"Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.\r\n",
    b"Did you ever think, \"I'm a kid\r\n",
    b"from the hive. I can't do this\"?\r\n",
    b"Bees have never been afraid\r\n",
    b"to change the world.\r\n",
    b"What about Bee Columbus?\r\n",
    b"Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?\r\n",
    b"Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\r\n",
    b"We were thinking\r\n",
    b"of stickball or candy stores.\r\n",
    b"How old are you?\r\n",
    b"The bee community\r\n",
    b"is supporting you in this case,\r\n",
    b"which will be the trial\r\n",
    b"of the bee century.\r\n",
    b"You know, they have a Larry King\r\n",
    b"in the human world too.\r\n",
    b"It's a common name. Next week...\r\n",
    b"He looks like you and has a show\r\n",
    b"and suspenders and colored dots...\r\n",
    b"Next week...\r\n",
    b"Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the\r\n",
    b"guest even though you just heard 'em.\r\n",
    b"Bear Week next week!\r\n",
    b"They're scary, hairy and here live.\r\n",
    b"Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,\r\n",
    b"squinty eyes, very Jewish.\r\n",
    b"In tennis, you attack\r\n",
    b"at the point of weakness!\r\n",
    b"It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\r\n",
    b"Honey, her backhand's a joke!\r\n",
    b"I'm not gonna take advantage of that?\r\n",
    b"Quiet, please.\r\n",
    b"Actual work going on here.\r\n",
    b"- Is that that same bee?\r\n",
    b"- Yes, it is!\r\n",
    b"I'm helping him sue the human race.\r\n",
    b"- Hello.\r\n",
    b"- Hello, bee.\r\n",
    b"This is Ken.\r\n",
    b"Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size\r\n",
    b"ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\r\n",
    b"Why does he talk again?\r\n",
    b"Listen, you better go\r\n",
    b"'cause we're really busy working.\r\n",
    b"But it's our yogurt night!\r\n",
    b"Bye-bye.\r\n",
    b"Why is yogurt night so difficult?!\r\n",
    b"You poor thing.\r\n",
    b"You two have been at this for hours!\r\n",
    b"Yes, and Adam here\r\n",
    b"has been a huge help.\r\n",
    b"- Frosting...\r\n",
    b"- How many sugars?\r\n",
    b"Just one. I try not\r\n",
    b"to use the competition.\r\n",
    b"So why are you helping me?\r\n",
    b"Bees have good qualities.\r\n",
    b"And it takes my mind off the shop.\r\n",
    b"Instead of flowers, people\r\n",
    b"are giving balloon bouquets now.\r\n",
    b"Those are great, if you're three.\r\n",
    b"And artificial flowers.\r\n",
    b"- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\r\n",
    b"- Yeah, me too.\r\n",
    b"Bent stingers, pointless pollination.\r\n",
    b"Bees must hate those fake things!\r\n",
    b"Nothing worse\r\n",
    b"than a daffodil that's had work done.\r\n",
    b"Maybe this could make up\r\n",
    b"for it a little bit.\r\n",
    b"- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\r\n",
    b"- I guess.\r\n",
    b"You sure you want to go through with it?\r\n",
    b"Am I sure? When I'm done with\r\n",
    b"the humans, they won't be able\r\n",
    b"to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\r\n",
    b"without paying a royalty!\r\n",
    b"It's an incredible scene\r\n",
    b"here in downtown Manhattan,\r\n",
    b"where the world anxiously waits,\r\n",
    b"because for the first time in history,\r\n",
    b"we will hear for ourselves\r\n",
    b"if a honeybee can actually speak.\r\n",
    b"What have we gotten into here, Barry?\r\n",
    b"It's pretty big, isn't it?\r\n",
    b"I can't believe how many humans\r\n",
    b"don't work during the day.\r\n",
    b"You think billion-dollar multinational\r\n",
    b"food companies have good lawyers?\r\n",
    b"Everybody needs to stay\r\n",
    b"behind the barricade.\r\n",
    b"- What's the matter?\r\n",
    b"- I don't know, I just got a chill.\r\n",
    b"Well, if it isn't the bee team.\r\n",
    b"You boys work on this?\r\n",
    b"All rise! The Honorable\r\n",
    b"Judge Bumbleton presiding.\r\n",
    b"All right. Case number 4475,\r\n",
    b"Superior Court of New York,\r\n",
    b"Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry\r\n",
    b"is now in session.\r\n",
    b"Mr. Montgomery, you're representing\r\n",
    b"the five food companies collectively?\r\n",
    b"A privilege.\r\n",
    b"Mr. Benson... you're representing\r\n",
    b"all the bees of the world?\r\n",
    b"I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,\r\n",
    b"we're ready to proceed.\r\n",
    b"Mr. Montgomery,\r\n",
    b"your opening statement, please.\r\n",
    b"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,\r\n",
    b"my grandmother was a simple woman.\r\n",
    b"Born on a farm, she believed\r\n",
    b"it was man's divine right\r\n",
    b"to benefit from the bounty\r\n",
    b"of nature God put before us.\r\n",
    b"If we lived in the topsy-turvy world\r\n",
    b"Mr. Benson imagines,\r\n",
    b"just think of what would it mean.\r\n",
    b"I would have to negotiate\r\n",
    b"with the silkworm\r\n",
    b"for the elastic in my britches!\r\n",
    b"Talking bee!\r\n",
    b"How do we know this isn't some sort of\r\n",
    b"holographic motion-picture-capture\r\n",
    b"Hollywood wizardry?\r\n",
    b"They could be using laser beams!\r\n",
    b"Robotics! Ventriloquism!\r\n",
    b"Cloning! For all we know,\r\n",
    b"he could be on steroids!\r\n",
    b"Mr. Benson?\r\n",
    b"Ladies and gentlemen,\r\n",
    b"there's no trickery here.\r\n",
    b"I'm just an ordinary bee.\r\n",
    b"Honey's pretty important to me.\r\n",
    b"It's important to all bees.\r\n",
    b"We invented it!\r\n",
    b"We make it. And we protect it\r\n",
    b"with our lives.\r\n",
    b"Unfortunately, there are\r\n",
    b"some people in this room\r\n",
    b"who think they can take it from us\r\n",
    b"'cause we're the little guys!\r\n",
    b"I'm hoping that, after this is all over,\r\n",
    b"you'll see how, by taking our honey,\r\n",
    b"you not only take everything we have\r\n",
    b"but everything we are!\r\n",
    b"I wish he'd dress like that\r\n",
    b"all the time. So nice!\r\n",
    b"Call your first witness.\r\n",
    b"So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\r\n",
    b"of Honey Farms, big company you have.\r\n",
    b"I suppose so.\r\n",
    b"I see you also own\r\n",
    b"Honeyburton and Honron!\r\n",
    b"Yes, they provide beekeepers\r\n",
    b"for our farms.\r\n",
    b"Beekeeper. I find that\r\n",
    b"to be a very disturbing term.\r\n",
    b"I don't imagine you employ\r\n",
    b"any bee-free-ers, do you?\r\n",
    b"- No.\r\n",
    b"- I couldn't hear you.\r\n",
    b"- No.\r\n",
    b"- No.\r\n",
    b"Because you don't free bees.\r\n",
    b"You keep bees. Not only that,\r\n",
    b"it seems you thought a bear would be\r\n",
    b"an appropriate image for a jar of honey.\r\n",
    b"They're very lovable creatures.\r\n",
    b"Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\r\n",
    b"You mean like this?\r\n",
    b"Bears kill bees!\r\n",
    b"How'd you like his head crashing\r\n",
    b"through your living room?!\r\n",
    b"Biting into your couch!\r\n",
    b"Spitting out your throw pillows!\r\n",
    b"OK, that's enough. Take him away.\r\n",
    b"So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\r\n",
    b"Your name intrigues me.\r\n",
    b"- Where have I heard it before?\r\n",
    b"- I was with a band called The Police.\r\n",
    b"But you've never been\r\n",
    b"a police officer, have you?\r\n",
    b"No, I haven't.\r\n",
    b"No, you haven't. And so here\r\n",
    b"we have yet another example\r\n",
    b"of bee culture casually\r\n",
    b"stolen by a human\r\n",
    b"for nothing more than\r\n",
    b"a prance-about stage name.\r\n",
    b"Oh, please.\r\n",
    b"Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\r\n",
    b"Because I'm feeling\r\n",
    b"a little stung, Sting.\r\n",
    b"Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\r\n",
    b"That's not his real name?! You idiots!\r\n",
    b"Mr. Liotta, first,\r\n",
    b"belated congratulations on\r\n",
    b"your Emmy win for a guest spot\r\n",
    b"on ER in 2005.\r\n",
    b"Thank you. Thank you.\r\n",
    b"I see from your resume\r\n",
    b"that you're devilishly handsome\r\n",
    b"with a churning inner turmoil\r\n",
    b"that's ready to blow.\r\n",
    b"I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\r\n",
    b"Not yet it isn't. But is this\r\n",
    b"what it's come to for you?\r\n",
    b"Exploiting tiny, helpless bees\r\n",
    b"so you don't\r\n",
    b"have to rehearse\r\n",
    b"your part and learn your lines, sir?\r\n",
    b"Watch it, Benson!\r\n",
    b"I could blow right now!\r\n",
    b"This isn't a goodfella.\r\n",
    b"This is a badfella!\r\n",
    b"Why doesn't someone just step on\r\n",
    b"this creep, and we can all go home?!\r\n",
    b"- Order in this court!\r\n",
    b"- You're all thinking it!\r\n",
    b"Order! Order, I say!\r\n",
    b"- Say it!\r\n",
    b"- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\r\n",
    b"I think it was awfully nice\r\n",
    b"of that bear to pitch in like that.\r\n",
    b"I think the jury's on our side.\r\n",
    b"Are we doing everything right, legally?\r\n",
    b"I'm a florist.\r\n",
    b"Right. Well, here's to a great team.\r\n",
    b"To a great team!\r\n",
    b"Well, hello.\r\n",
    b"- Ken!\r\n",
    b"- Hello.\r\n",
    b"I didn't think you were coming.\r\n",
    b"No, I was just late.\r\n",
    b"I tried to call, but... the battery.\r\n",
    b"I didn't want all this to go to waste,\r\n",
    b"so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\r\n",
    b"Oh, that was lucky.\r\n",
    b"There's a little left.\r\n",
    b"I could heat it up.\r\n",
    b"Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\n",
    b"So I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\n",
    b"I'm not much for the game myself.\r\n",
    b"The ball's a little grabby.\r\n",
    b"That's where I usually sit.\r\n",
    b"Right... there.\r\n",
    b"Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,\r\n",
    b"and he agreed with me that eating with\r\n",
    b"chopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\n",
    b"You think I don't see what you're doing?\r\n",
    b"I know how hard it is to find\r\n",
    b"the rightjob. We have that in common.\r\n",
    b"Do we?\r\n",
    b"Bees have 100 percent employment,\r\n",
    b"but we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\n",
    b"That's just what\r\n",
    b"I was thinking about doing.\r\n",
    b"Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor\r\n",
    b"for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\r\n",
    b"I'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\n",
    b"Yeah, you do that.\r\n",
    b"Look at that.\r\n",
    b"You know, I've just about had it\r\n",
    b"with your little mind games.\r\n",
    b"- What's that?\r\n",
    b"- Italian Vogue.\r\n",
    b"Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\n",
    b"A lot of ads.\r\n",
    b"Remember what Van said, why is\r\n",
    b"your life more valuable than mine?\r\n",
    b"Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!\r\n",
    b"I think something stinks in here!\r\n",
    b"I love the smell of flowers.\r\n",
    b"How do you like the smell of flames?!\r\n",
    b"Not as much.\r\n",
    b"Water bug! Not taking sides!\r\n",
    b"Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!\r\n",
    b"This is pathetic!\r\n",
    b"I've got issues!\r\n",
    b"Well, well, well, a royal flush!\r\n",
    b"- You're bluffing.\r\n",
    b"- Am I?\r\n",
    b"Surf's up, dude!\r\n",
    b"Poo water!\r\n",
    b"That bowl is gnarly.\r\n",
    b"Except for those dirty yellow rings!\r\n",
    b"Kenneth! What are you doing?!\r\n",
    b"You know, I don't even like honey!\r\n",
    b"I don't eat it!\r\n",
    b"We need to talk!\r\n",
    b"He's just a little bee!\r\n",
    b"And he happens to be\r\n",
    b"the nicest bee I've met in a long time!\r\n",
    b"Long time? What are you talking about?!\r\n",
    b"Are there other bugs in your life?\r\n",
    b"No, but there are other things bugging\r\n",
    b"me in life. And you're one of them!\r\n",
    b"Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\n",
    b"My nerves are fried from riding\r\n",
    b"on this emotional roller coaster!\r\n",
    b"Goodbye, Ken.\r\n",
    b"And for your information,\r\n",
    b"I prefer sugar-free, artificial\r\n",
    b"sweeteners made by man!\r\n",
    b"I'm sorry about all that.\r\n",
    b"I know it's got\r\n",
    b"an aftertaste! I like it!\r\n",
    b"I always felt there was some kind\r\n",
    b"of barrier between Ken and me.\r\n",
    b"I couldn't overcome it.\r\n",
    b"Oh, well.\r\n",
    b"Are you OK for the trial?\r\n",
    b"I believe Mr. Montgomery\r\n",
    b"is about out of ideas.\r\n",
    b"We would like to call\r\n",
    b"Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\n",
    b"Good idea! You can really see why he's\r\n",
    b"considered one of the best lawyers...\r\n",
    b"Yeah.\r\n",
    b"Layton, you've\r\n",
    b"gotta weave some magic\r\n",
    b"with this jury,\r\n",
    b"or it's gonna be all over.\r\n",
    b"Don't worry. The only thing I have\r\n",
    b"to do to turn this jury around\r\n",
    b"is to remind them\r\n",
    b"of what they don't like about bees.\r\n",
    b"- You got the tweezers?\r\n",
    b"- Are you allergic?\r\n",
    b"Only to losing, son. Only to losing.\r\n",
    b"Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\r\n",
    b"what I think we'd all like to know.\r\n",
    b"What exactly is your relationship\r\n",
    b"to that woman?\r\n",
    b"We're friends.\r\n",
    b"- Good friends?\r\n",
    b"- Yes.\r\n",
    b"How good? Do you live together?\r\n",
    b"Wait a minute...\r\n",
    b"Are you her little...\r\n",
    b"...bedbug?\r\n",
    b"I've seen a bee documentary or two.\r\n",
    b"From what I understand,\r\n",
    b"doesn't your queen give birth\r\n",
    b"to all the bee children?\r\n",
    b"- Yeah, but...\r\n",
    b"- So those aren't your real parents!\r\n",
    b"- Oh, Barry...\r\n",
    b"- Yes, they are!\r\n",
    b"Hold me back!\r\n",
    b"You're an illegitimate bee,\r\n",
    b"aren't you, Benson?\r\n",
    b"He's denouncing bees!\r\n",
    b"Don't y'all date your cousins?\r\n",
    b"- Objection!\r\n",
    b"- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\r\n",
    b"Adam, don't! It's what he wants!\r\n",
    b"Oh, I'm hit!!\r\n",
    b"Oh, lordy, I am hit!\r\n",
    b"Order! Order!\r\n",
    b"The venom! The venom\r\n",
    b"is coursing through my veins!\r\n",
    b"I have been felled\r\n",
    b"by a winged beast of destruction!\r\n",
    b"You see? You can't treat them\r\n",
    b"like equals! They're striped savages!\r\n",
    b"Stinging's the only thing\r\n",
    b"they know! It's their way!\r\n",
    b"- Adam, stay with me.\r\n",
    b"- I can't feel my legs.\r\n",

    b"The case of the honeybees\r\n",
    b"versus the human race\r\n",
    b"took a pointed turn against the bees\r\n",
    b"yesterday when one of their legal\r\n",
    b"team stung Layton T. Montgomery.\r\n",
    b"- Hey, buddy.\r\n",
    b"- Hey.\r\n",
    b"- Is there much pain?\r\n",
    b"- Yeah.\r\n",
    b"I...\r\n",
    b"I blew the whole case, didn't I?\r\n",
    b"It doesn't matter. What matters is\r\n",
    b"you're alive. You could have died.\r\n",
    b"I'd be better off dead. Look at me.\r\n",
    b"They got it from the cafeteria\r\n",
    b"downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\r\n",
    b"Look, there's\r\n",
    b"a little celery still on it.\r\n",
    b"What was it like to sting someone?\r\n",
    b"I can't explain it. It was all...\r\n",
    b"All adrenaline and then...\r\n",
    b"and then ecstasy!\r\n",
    b"All right.\r\n",
    b"You think it was all a trap?\r\n",
    b"Of course. I'm sorry.\r\n",
    b"I flew us right into this.\r\n",
    b"What were we thinking? Look at us. We're\r\n",

    b"Could you get a nurse\r\n",
    b"to close that window?\r\n",
    b"- Why?\r\n",
    b"- The smoke.\r\n",
    b"Bees don't smoke.\r\n",
    b"Right. Bees don't smoke.\r\n",
    b"Bees don't smoke!\r\n",
    b"But some bees are smoking.\r\n",

    b"Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.\r\n",

    b"taken up enough\r\n",
    b"of this court's valuable time?\r\n",

    b"It's a bee smoker!\r\n",
    b"What, this?\r\n",
    b"This harmless little contraption?\r\n",
    b"This couldn't hurt a fly,\r\n",
    b"let alone a bee.\r\n",

    b"to bees who have never been asked,\r\n",
    b"\"Smoking or non?\"\r\n",

    b"All right. One at a time.\r\n",
    b"Barry, who are you wearing?\r\n",

    b"First, we'll demand a complete shutdown\r\n",

    b"Then we want back the honey\r\n",
    b"that was ours to begin with,\r\n",
    b"every last drop.\r\n",

    b"But it's just a prance-about stage name!\r\n",
    b"...unnecessary inclusion of honey\r\n",

    b"Stop making honey!\r\n",
    b"Turn your key, sir!\r\n",
    b"What do we do now?\r\n",
    b"Cannonball!\r\n",
    b"We're shutting honey production!\r\n",
    b"Mission abort.\r\n",
    b"Aborting pollination and nectar detail.\r\n",
    b"Returning to base.\r\n",
    b"Adam, you wouldn't believe\r\n",

    b"Oh, yeah?\r\n",

    b"I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way\r\n",
    b"to San Antonio with a cricket.\r\n",
    b"At least we got our honey back.\r\n",
    b"Sometimes I think, so what if humans\r\n",
    b"liked our honey? Who wouldn't?\r\n",
    b"It's the greatest thing in the world!\r\n",
    b"I was excited to be part of making it.\r\n",
    b"This was my new desk. This was my\r\n",
    b"new job. I wanted to do it really well.\r\n",
    b"And now...\r\n",
    b"Now I can't.\r\n",
    b"I don't understand\r\n",
    b"why they're not happy.\r\n",
    b"I thought their lives would be better!\r\n",
    b"They're doing nothing. It's amazing.\r\n",
    b"Honey really changes people.\r\n",
    b"You don't have any idea\r\n",
    b"what's going on, do you?\r\n",
    b"- What did you want to show me?\r\n",
    b"- This.\r\n",
    b"What happened here?\r\n",
    b"That is not the half of it.\r\n",
    b"Oh, no. Oh, my.\r\n",
    b"They're all wilting.\r\n",
    b"Doesn't look very good, does it?\r\n",
    b"No.\r\n",
    b"And whose fault do you think that is?\r\n",
    b"You know, I'm gonna guess bees.\r\n",
    b"Bees?\r\n",
    b"Specifically, me.\r\n",
    b"I didn't think bees not needing to make\r\n",
    b"honey would affect all these things.\r\n",
    b"It's notjust flowers.\r\n",
    b"Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\r\n",
    b"That's our whole SAT test right there.\r\n",
    b"Take away produce, that affects\r\n",
    b"the entire animal kingdom.\r\n",
    b"And then, of course...\r\n",
    b"The human species?\r\n",
    b"So if there's no more pollination,\r\n",
    b"it could all just go south here,\r\n",
    b"couldn't it?\r\n",
    b"I know this is also partly my fault.\r\n",
    b"How about a suicide pact?\r\n",
    b"How do we do it?\r\n",
    b"- I'll sting you, you step on me.\r\n",
    b"- Thatjust kills you twice.\r\n",
    b"Right, right.\r\n",
    b"Listen, Barry...\r\n",
    b"sorry, but I gotta get going.\r\n",
    b"I had to open my mouth and talk.\r\n",
    b"Vanessa?\r\n",
    b"Vanessa? Why are you leaving?\r\n",
    b"Where are you going?\r\n",
    b"To the final Tournament of Roses parade\r\n",
    b"in Pasadena.\r\n",
    b"They've moved it to this weekend\r\n",
    b"because all the flowers are dying.\r\n",
    b"It's the last chance\r\n",
    b"I'll ever have to see it.\r\n",
    b"Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\r\n",
    b"I never meant it to turn out like this.\r\n",
    b"I know. Me neither.\r\n",
    b"Tournament of Roses.\r\n",
    b"Roses can't do sports.\r\n",
    b"Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?\r\n",
    b"Roses!\r\n",
    b"Vanessa!\r\n",
    b"Roses?!\r\n",
    b"Barry?\r\n",
    b"- Roses are flowers!\r\n",
    b"- Yes, they are.\r\n",
    b"Flowers, bees, pollen!\r\n",
    b"I know.\r\n",
    b"That's why this is the last parade.\r\n",
    b"Maybe not.\r\n",
    b"Could you ask him to slow down?\r\n",
    b"Could you slow down?\r\n",
    b"Barry!\r\n",
    b"OK, I made a huge mistake.\r\n",
    b"This is a total disaster, all my fault.\r\n",
    b"Yes, it kind of is.\r\n",
    b"I've ruined the planet.\r\n",
    b"I wanted to help you\r\n",
    b"with the flower shop.\r\n",
    b"I've made it worse.\r\n",
    b"Actually, it's completely closed down.\r\n",
    b"I thought maybe you were remodeling.\r\n",
    b"But I have another idea, and it's\r\n",
    b"greater than my previous ideas combined.\r\n",
    b"I don't want to hear it!\r\n",
    b"All right, they have the roses,\r\n",
    b"the roses have the pollen.\r\n",
    b"I know every bee, plant\r\n",
    b"and flower bud in this park.\r\n",
    b"All we gotta do is get what they've got\r\n",
    b"back here with what we've got.\r\n",
    b"- Bees.\r\n",
    b"- Park.\r\n",
    b"- Pollen!\r\n",
    b"- Flowers.\r\n",
    b"- Repollination!\r\n",
    b"- Across the nation!\r\n",
    b"Tournament of Roses,\r\n",
    b"Pasadena, California.\r\n",
    b"They've got nothing\r\n",
    b"but flowers, floats and cotton candy.\r\n",
    b"Security will be tight.\r\n",
    b"I have an idea.\r\n",
    b"Vanessa Bloome, FTD.\r\n",
    b"Official floral business. It's real.\r\n",
    b"Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\r\n",
    b"Thank you. It was a gift.\r\n",
    b"Once inside,\r\n",
    b"we just pick the right float.\r\n",
    b"How about The Princess and the Pea?\r\n",
    b"I could be the princess,\r\n",
    b"and you could be the pea!\r\n",
    b"Yes, I got it.\r\n",
    b"- Where should I sit?\r\n",
    b"- What are you?\r\n",
    b"- I believe I'm the pea.\r\n",
    b"- The pea?\r\n",
    b"It goes under the mattresses.\r\n",
    b"- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\r\n",
    b"- I'm getting the marshal.\r\n",
    b"You do that!\r\n",
    b"This whole parade is a fiasco!\r\n",
    b"Let's see what this baby'll do.\r\n",
    b"Hey, what are you doing?!\r\n",
    b"Then all we do\r\n",
    b"is blend in with traffic...\r\n",
    b"...without arousing suspicion.\r\n",
    b"Once at the airport,\r\n",
    b"there's no stopping us.\r\n",
    b"Stop! Security.\r\n",
    b"- You and your insect pack your float?\r\n",
    b"- Yes.\r\n",
    b"Has it been\r\n",
    b"in your possession the entire time?\r\n",
    b"Would you remove your shoes?\r\n",
    b"- Remove your stinger.\r\n",
    b"- It's part of me.\r\n",
    b"I know. Just having some fun.\r\n",
    b"Enjoy your flight.\r\n",
    b"Then if we're lucky, we'll have\r\n",
    b"just enough pollen to do the job.\r\n",
    b"Can you believe how lucky we are? We\r\n",
    b"have just enough pollen to do the job!\r\n",
    b"I think this is gonna work.\r\n",
    b"It's got to work.\r\n",
    b"Attention, passengers,\r\n",
    b"this is Captain Scott.\r\n",
    b"We have a bit of bad weather\r\n",
    b"in New York.\r\n",
    b"It looks like we'll experience\r\n",
    b"a couple hours delay.\r\n",
    b"Barry, these are cut flowers\r\n",
    b"with no water. They'll never make it.\r\n",
    b"I gotta get up there\r\n",
    b"and talk to them.\r\n",
    b"Be careful.\r\n",
    b"Can I get help\r\n",
    b"with the Sky Mall magazine?\r\n",
    b"I'd like to order the talking\r\n",
    b"inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\r\n",
    b"Captain, I'm in a real situation.\r\n",
    b"- What'd you say, Hal?\r\n",
    b"- Nothing.\r\n",
    b"Bee!\r\n",
    b"Don't freak out! My entire species...\r\n",
    b"What are you doing?\r\n",
    b"- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\r\n",
    b"- Who's an attorney?\r\n",
    b"Don't move.\r\n",
    b"Oh, Barry.\r\n",
    b"Good afternoon, passengers.\r\n",
    b"This is your captain.\r\n",
    b"Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B\r\n",
    b"please report to the cockpit?\r\n",
    b"And please hurry!\r\n",
    b"What happened here?\r\n",
    b"There was a DustBuster,\r\n",
    b"a toupee, a life raft exploded.\r\n",
    b"One's bald, one's in a boat,\r\n",
    b"they're both unconscious!\r\n",
    b"- Is that another bee joke?\r\n",
    b"- No!\r\n",
    b"No one's flying the plane!\r\n",
    b"This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\r\n",
    b"What's your status?\r\n",
    b"This is Vanessa Bloome.\r\n",
    b"I'm a florist from New York.\r\n",
    b"Where's the pilot?\r\n",
    b"He's unconscious,\r\n",
    b"and so is the copilot.\r\n",
    b"Not good. Does anyone onboard\r\n",
    b"have flight experience?\r\n",
    b"As a matter of fact, there is.\r\n",
    b"- Who's that?\r\n",
    b"- Barry Benson.\r\n",
    b"From the honey trial?! Oh, great.\r\n",
    b"Vanessa, this is nothing more\r\n",
    b"than a big metal bee.\r\n",
    b"It's got giant wings, huge engines.\r\n",
    b"I can't fly a plane.\r\n",
    b"- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\r\n",
    b"- Yes.\r\n",
    b"How hard could it be?\r\n",
    b"Wait, Barry!\r\n",
    b"We're headed into some lightning.\r\n",
    b"This is Bob Bumble. We have some\r\n",
    b"late-breaking news from JFK Airport,\r\n",
    b"where a suspenseful scene\r\n",
    b"is developing.\r\n",
    b"Barry Benson,\r\n",
    b"fresh from his legal victory...\r\n",
    b"That's Barry!\r\n",
    b"...is attempting to land a plane,\r\n",
    b"loaded with people, flowers\r\n",
    b"and an incapacitated flight crew.\r\n",
    b"Flowers?!\r\n",
    b"We have a storm in the area\r\n",
    b"and two individuals at the controls\r\n",
    b"with absolutely no flight experience.\r\n",
    b"Just a minute.\r\n",
    b"There's a bee on that plane.\r\n",
    b"I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\r\n",
    b"and his no-account compadres.\r\n",
    b"They've done enough damage.\r\n",
    b"But isn't he your only hope?\r\n",
    b"Technically, a bee\r\n",
    b"shouldn't be able to fly at all.\r\n",
    b"Their wings are too small...\r\n",
    b"Haven't we heard this a million times?\r\n",
    b"\"The surface area of the wings\r\n",
    b"and body mass make no sense.\"\r\n",
    b"- Get this on the air!\r\n",
    b"- Got it.\r\n",
    b"- Stand by.\r\n",
    b"- We're going live.\r\n",
    b"The way we work may be a mystery to you.\r\n",
    b"Making honey takes a lot of bees\r\n",
    b"doing a lot of small jobs.\r\n",
    b"But let me tell you about a small job.\r\n",
    b"If you do it well,\r\n",
    b"it makes a big difference.\r\n",
    b"More than we realized.\r\n",
    b"To us, to everyone.\r\n",
    b"That's why I want to get bees\r\n",
    b"back to working together.\r\n",
    b"That's the bee way!\r\n",
    b"We're not made of Jell-O.\r\n",
    b"We get behind a fellow.\r\n",
    b"- Black and yellow!\r\n",
    b"- Hello!\r\n",
    b"Left, right, down, hover.\r\n",
    b"- Hover?\r\n",
    b"- Forget hover.\r\n",
    b"This isn't so hard.\r\n",
    b"Beep-beep! Beep-beep!\r\n",
    b"Barry, what happened?!\r\n",
    b"Wait, I think we were\r\n",
    b"on autopilot the whole time.\r\n",
    b"- That may have been helping me.\r\n",
    b"- And now we're not!\r\n",
    b"So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\r\n",
    b"All of you, let's get\r\n",
    b"behind this fellow! Move it out!\r\n",
    b"Move out!\r\n",
    b"Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,\r\n",
    b"you copy me with the wings of the plane!\r\n",
    b"Don't have to yell.\r\n",
    b"I'm not yelling!\r\n",
    b"We're in a lot of trouble.\r\n",
    b"It's very hard to concentrate\r\n",
    b"with that panicky tone in your voice!\r\n",
    b"It's not a tone. I'm panicking!\r\n",
    b"I can't do this!\r\n",
    b"Vanessa, pull yourself together.\r\n",
    b"You have to snap out of it!\r\n",
    b"You snap out of it.\r\n",
    b"You snap out of it.\r\n",

    b"Thank you, Barry!\r\n",
    b"That bee is living my life!\r\n",
    b"Let it go, Kenny.\r\n",
    b"- When will this nightmare end?!\r\n",
    b"- Let it all go.\r\n",
    b"- Beautiful day to fly.\r\n",
    b"- Sure is.\r\n",
    b"Between you and me,\r\n",
    b"I was dying to get out of that office.\r\n",
